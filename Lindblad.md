# The Note of Lindblad Equation

Base on [A simple derivation of Lindblad equation](https://doi.org/10.1590/S1806-11172013000100003)
Consider a System interact with a bath, the Hamiltonian of system is $\hat{H}_S$ and the bath is $\hat{H}_B$.
And the total Hamiltonian is 
$$
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_S \otimes \Bbb{I} + \Bbb{I} \otimes \hat{H}_B + \hat{H}_{SB}
$$
